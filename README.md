Develop a real-time computer vision algorithm to detect and count the number of times one or more 
balls bounce off the floor.

Level 1 - Basic Single Ball Detection: 
• Implement an algorithm to detect and count bounces for a single ball. 
• Real-time processing capability is required. 
• Handle variations in lighting and minor visual noise. 
Level 2 - Multiple Balls Detection: 
• Extend the algorithm to accurately track and count bounces for multiple balls simultaneously. 
• Each ball may have different physical characteristics (size, color, bounce dynamics). 
• Maintain real-time processing capability. 
Level 3 - Obstacle Interaction: 
• Introduce obstacles in the video where balls can interact (e.g., bounce off, hide behind). 
• Algorithm must differentiate between bounces off the floor and interactions with obstacles. 
• Continue to provide real-time processing and accurate counting.
